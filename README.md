Prompt-Engineering-Guide


This repository provides an implementation of prompt engineering techniques for machine learning models, including how to load models, utilize various prompts, and experiment with different temperature settings to control model output. It also demonstrates how to optimize and adjust the prompt for better responses.

Features

Model Loading: 

Learn how to load and initialize different language models.
Prompt Engineering: Techniques for designing and structuring prompts to get desired outputs from models.
Temperature Control: Explanation of the temperature setting and how it influences the randomness of the model's responses.
Response Data: How to extract, analyze, and understand the modelâ€™s responses based on input prompts.
